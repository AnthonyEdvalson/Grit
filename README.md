# Grit

Grit is a productivity and time management tool that encourages specific behaviors through a point-based system.


Using Grit is simple. Click on the task you are currently working on to start a timer. If you are doing a productive task, you will earn "grits" as long as you are doing that task.
If the task is task is not productive, you will spend grits. Then when you've finished the task you stop the timer.


The purpose of Grit is to make it clear how productive you are, and to use gamification to encourage certain behaviors.
